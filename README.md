Vaadin QuickTickets Dashboard Demo
==================================

Sources for the official Vaadin desktop browser demo application: http://demo.vaadin.com/dashboard

![QuickTickets Dashboard](https://vaadin.com/image/image_gallery?uuid=0333a002-1e66-43f4-b127-b7da911a3cb3&groupId=10187&t=1359053559577)

To run
==
Currently the Maven project is missing the parent pom.xml (this repo was split from a multi-module project), and it won't build correctly. This will be fixed later.


Licenses
==
The source code is released under Apache 2.0.

The application uses a couple of add-ons:
 * Vaadin Charts, AGPL/CVAL: https://vaadin.com/license/cval-2.0
 * Vaadin Calendar, Apache 2.0
 * CSSInject, Apache 2.0
